		<h2>Mason Basktball</h2>
		<ul>

		<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
		this is a basketball game with very basic use of the controllers and colors
		</li>

		<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
		I want the player to have the expierence that he is playing a George Mason Game and that he is representing the Patriots.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
		sports/arcade
		</li>

		<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
		Player has to collect all the starts and the ones on the top right corner will be extra hard because they have to jump in an angle.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
		To learn more about colors and other bugs that the player can work with
		</li>

		<li><strong>Features:</strong>
		the helmet color of the player is change to match the Mason team, a clean sounds everytime that the star is pick, and also the background as well is change to show the basketball court in Mason
		</li>

		<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
		The world is a basketball court, the charechtor is the Mason Dude. What makes this worls unique it suppost to show the campus of Mason. No backstory yet but working in it
		</li>

		<li><strong>Story:</strong>
		no story yet
		</li>

		<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
		George Mason students that are trying to learn more about coding
		</li>

		<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
		1 minute or more
		</li>

		<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>use the agility to jump high to get more starts
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
	yeah I use the basis of the tutorial from the Phaser wevsite
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
		is also about collecting the start and having sounds and a good time
		</li>
